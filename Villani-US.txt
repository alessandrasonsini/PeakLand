1.  	As a user, I want to look for an itinerary based on:
	·         distance from my address
	·         difficulty level
	·         path length
	·         type of landscape
	·         cycle or pedestrian path
	so I can choose the perfect mountain path for me.
2.  	As a logged user, I want to add new itineraries I visited which aren’t on the system yet, so I can help the community grow.
3.  	As a logged user, I want to save itineraries I visited so I can keep track of them.
